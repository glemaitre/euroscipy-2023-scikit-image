Yeast microarrays for genome wide parallel genetic and gene
expression analysis

Two-color fluorescent scan of a yeast microarray containing 2,479 elements
(ORFs). The center-to-center distance between elements is 345 μm. A probe
mixture consisting of cDNA from yeast extract/peptone (YEP) galactose (green
pseudocolor) and YEP glucose (red pseudocolor) grown yeast cultures was
hybridized to the array. Intensity per element corresponds to ORF expression,
and pseudocolor per element corresponds to relative ORF expression between the
two cultures.
